This is a dynamic and interactive web application that fetches and displays real-time weather data. Built with fundamental web technologies, the app demonstrates key concepts of front-end development, including API integration, dynamic DOM manipulation, and responsive design.

Features
City Search: Users can get current weather information for any city by typing its name into the search bar.

Real-time Data: Displays essential weather metrics such as temperature (Â°C), humidity, and wind speed.

Dynamic Visuals: The background of the application changes automatically to match the current weather conditions, creating an immersive user experience.

Responsive Design: The app's layout adjusts gracefully to fit different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop computers.

Error Handling: Provides clear and concise alerts for invalid city names or network errors, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the foundational structure of the app, including the search bar and the containers for displaying weather data.

CSS: Styles the entire application, handling the layout, colors, typography, and the dynamic background changes.

JavaScript: Powers the application's logic. It handles user input, makes asynchronous requests to the weather API, processes the data, and dynamically updates the content and visuals on the page.

API Information
This project relies on the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve accurate and up-to-date weather information. This is a common and reliable service used by many weather applications.

To run this app locally, you will need your own unique API key from OpenWeatherMap.
